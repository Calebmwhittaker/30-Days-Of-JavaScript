//Common Conventions for Writing Clean Code
/*Conventions:
    camelCase for variables and functions
    ALL variable names start with a letter
    Use of 'const' for constants, arrays, objects, or functions
    Use of single quotes or backticks
    Semicolons are not necessary and are of personal preference
    Includes spaces around arithmetic operators, assignments and after commas
    Use of arrow functions instead of function declarations
    Use of explicit returns instead of implicit returns if a function is a one-liner
    No trailing comma in the last value of an object
    Use of the +=, -=, *=, /= **= instead of having to redeclare the variable
    Print a tag string when using console.log() to know where the console is coming from
    Array names are plural */
